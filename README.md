`println!` when calling a rust macro and `println` when calling a function

#### running a rust file without cargo or any other tool or package manager :

- create a.rs
- run `rustc a.rs` in terminal
- run `./a` in terminal

- `cargo check` to check that the code compiles but not producing an executable.

- cargo build --release

- string literals are string slices
- `binary crate` - which is executable
- `library crate` - contains code that is intended to be used in other programs, and can't be executed on its own
- `trim` - this method on a string eliminates any whitespace at the beginning and end.
- Rust has two primitive compound types : Tuples and Arrays
- NO fsize data type : only f32 and f64
- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.
- Expressions do not include ending semicolons
- statements donâ€™t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), the unit type.

### Memory is the space where data is stored during the execution of a program.

### Ownership is discipline of _pointer_ management.

- A frame is a mapping from variables to values within a single scope, such as a function.
- A pointer is a value that describes a location in memory.
- The value that pointer points to is called **pointee** .

> Heap is a separate region of memory where data can live indefinitely. Heap data is not tied to a spcific stack frame. Rust provides a construct called `Box` for putting data on the heap.

> **Box Deallocation priciple** : If a variable owns a box, when Rust deallocates the variable's frame, then Rust deallocates the box's heap memory.
> Box are used by Rust data structures like Vec, String, and HashMap to hold a variable number of elements.

- Heap data can only be accessed through its current owner, not a previous owner.

### REFERENCES AND BORROWING

- A **reference** is a kind of pointer. References are non-owning pointers because they do not own the data they point to.

- Aliasing is accessing same data through different variables.
- The macro `vec!` creates a vector with the elements between the brackets.

> **Pointer Safety Principle** : Data should never be aliased and mutated at the same time.

> Immutable References are read-only( also called **shared references**). They allow aliasing but disallow mutation.
> Mutable References : Temporarily provide mutable access to data without moving it. (also called **unique references**).

- _Safe_ - Mutable references allow mutation but prevent aliasing. The borrowed path becomes temporarily unusable, so effectively not an alias
- _Useful_ - The mutable reference itself cannot be reassigned to a different mutable reference.

- Data Must Outlive All Of Its References

> The `F` permission : Expected whenever an expression uses an input reference(like &strings[0]), or returns an output reference(like `return s_ref`).

- 1) Input/Output references are treated differently than references within a function body
- 2) Rust uses a different mechanism, the `F` permission, to check hte safety of those references.
