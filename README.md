`println!` when calling a rust macro and `println` when calling a function

#### running a rust file without cargo or any other tool or package manager :
- create a.rs
- run `rustc a.rs` in terminal
- run `./a` in terminal

- `cargo check` to check that the code compiles but not producing an executable.

- cargo build --release 

- string literals are string slices
- `binary crate` - which is executable
- `library crate` - contains code that is intended to be used in other programs, and can't be executed on its own
- `trim` - this method on a string eliminates any whitespace at the beginning and end.
- Rust has two primitive compound types : Tuples and Arrays
- NO fsize data type : only f32 and f64
- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.
- Expressions do not include ending semicolons
- statements donâ€™t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), the unit type.
